## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r problem1}

library(tidyverse)
dataframe = tibble (
  x = rnorm(8),
  vec_logical = x > 0,
  vec_char = c("I'm Dania"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium")))

mean(pull(dataframe, x))
mean(pull(dataframe, vec_logical))
mean(pull(dataframe, vec_char))
mean(pull(dataframe, vec_factor))
```
#a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
#a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
#a character vector of length 8
#a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”
# taking the mean of x and vec_logical works but it doesn't work to take the mean of vec_factor and vec_char. 

```{r problem1.1, results = 'hide'}
log_to_num = as.numeric(pull(dataframe, vec_logical))
char_to_num = as.numeric(pull(dataframe, vec_char))
fac_to_num = as.numeric(pull(dataframe, vec_factor))
```
#I see that that the logical and numeric variables are are able to be converted to numeric but the character variable is not. This helps to explain why I got a mean of 0.25 for the mean of the logical variable. This is because R already has default values of 1 and 0 for true and false, respectively. 
```{r problem1.2}
x = rnorm(8)
a = as.numeric(pull(dataframe, vec_logical)) * x
b = as.factor(pull(dataframe, vec_logical)) * x
c = as.numeric(b) * x
```

```{r problem2}

library(tidyverse)

dataframe2 = tibble(
x = rnorm (500),
y = rnorm (500),
vec_logical = x + y > 1,
d = as.numeric(vec_logical),
e = as.factor(vec_logical)
)
```

## Description of the dataframe 

* The size of the dataframe is `r nrow(dataframe2)` and the number of columns are `r ncol(dataframe2)`  
* The mean of x is `r mean(pull(dataframe2,x))`
* The median of x is `r median(pull(dataframe2, x))`
* The standard deviation of x is `r sd(pull(dataframe2, x))`
* The proportion of cases for which x + y > 1 is `r sum(pull(dataframe2,vec_logical),na.rm=TRUE)/500`


```{r}
# A scatterplot of y vs x
plot1 = ggplot(dataframe2, aes( x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = vec_logical))

plot1
```
Since a logical vector has a value of True or False, the key shows those two values and they are each given their own color (true = teal and false = coral), those are the points we see output. 

```{r}
#A second scatterplot using numeric variables
plot2 = ggplot(dataframe2, aes( x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = d))

plot2
```
Here we see a gradient of color from light blue to dark blue. However, since the the numeric value of the logical vector is 0 or 1, we just see the colors for 0 and 1 on the graph, which are light blue and dark blue. We don't see the internmediates. 

```{r}
#A third scatterplot using factor variables
plot3 = ggplot(dataframe2, aes( x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = e))

plot3
```
This plot is essentially the same as the logical vector scatterplot. In this case, the key shows 0 and 1 instead of false and true, but it corresponds to the same thing. 

```{r}
ggsave ("question2.pdf", plot = plot1)
